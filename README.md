### Option 1 Gaussian Process for Human Activity Recognition using smartphones with embedded inertial sensors
Dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones#.    
Gaussian Process: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_process.    
Python sample program for Gaussian Process: https://www.tensorflow.org/probability/examples/Gaussian_Process_Regression_In_TFP.   
* The advantage of ML that I think: Care facility and hospital staff are busy with a lot of nursing care work. Therefore, it is difficult to understand each patient in detail. By automatically estimating the patient's physical activity from the data acquired from the smartphone, it is possible to know the detailed patient's condition without interfering with work. 
* The disadvantage of ML that I think: With the increasing automation of patient management, the work becomes too rational. Human communication may be reduced.
